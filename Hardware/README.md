# DayMoonYearMovement Hardware

This is the circuit board for the Present's [Day Moon Year Clock](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottthrift/the-present-day-moon-year).

It is basically a brain transplant for an existing standard UCT 24h movement that drives with modes that take a day, a lunar month, or a year to cycle. 

To use this board, you must disassemble the original movement, remove the gear that links the hours and minutes shafts, and then glue those shafts together so that the hours shaft is now driven by the minutes gearing.
